## Comprehensive Documentation for Crypto Arbitrage Trading Strategy and Bot

### 1. Introduction

This repository contains a Python-based bot for crypto arbitrage trading. The bot exploits price discrepancies across exchanges like OKX, Binance, and Coinbase Pro to generate low-risk profits. Built with CCXT for exchange integration, it's tailored for users in Germany under EU MiCA regulations.

#### Key Objectives
- Achieve small, consistent profits through automation.
- Minimize risks with market-neutral strategies.
- Provide extensible code for advanced users.

#### Assumptions
- Basic Python knowledge and API keys required.
- For educational purposes; trading risks apply.

### 2. Arbitrage Strategies

The bot focuses on spatial arbitrage but supports extensions.

#### 2.1 Spatial (Cross-Exchange) Arbitrage
- Buy low on one exchange, sell high on another.
- Profit: Net = Gross - Fees - Transfers.

#### 2.2 Triangular Arbitrage
- Cycle trades within one exchange.

#### 2.3 Funding Rate Arbitrage
- Hedge spot and perps for yields.

#### 2.4 Statistical Arbitrage
- Trade correlated pairs.

#### 2.5 Event-Driven Arbitrage
- Exploit unlocks and events.

#### 2.6 Cross-Chain Arbitrage

### 3. Bot Framework

Modular class-based design.

#### 3.1 Architecture
- Data fetching, detection, execution, logging.

#### 3.2 Dependencies
- `ccxt`, `python-dotenv`
- Install: `pip install -r requirements.txt`

### 4. Code Overview

See `main.py` for the full bot code.

### 5. Setup

1. Clone repo.
2. Create `.env` with API keys.
3. Run `python main.py`.

#### Testnet
- Enable in code for safe testing.

### 6. Risk Management

- Fees, slippage, transfers.
- Start small; monitor volatility.

### 7. Legal/Tax (Germany)

- Comply with MiCA.
- Tax gains as income if <1 year hold.

### 8. Best Practices
